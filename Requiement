Step 0: Before you start
You will need to make sure you have the following components installed and set up before you start with Amazon EKS:

AWS CLI – while you can use the AWS Console to create a cluster in EKS, the AWS CLI is easier. You will need version 1.16.73 at least. For further instructions, click here.
Kubectl – used for communicating with the cluster API server. For further instructions on installing, click here. This endpoint is public by default, but is secured by proper configuration of a VPC (see below).
AWS-IAM-Authenticator – to allow IAM authentication with the Kubernetes cluster. Check out the repo on GitHub for instructions on setting this up.
